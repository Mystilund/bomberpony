# Bomberpony

This project was a kind of game created at the end of my second Year of {EPITECH}.

A game made with c++ and a custom library from Epitech. It requires opengl and sfml 1.6

I tried to run it, but it didn't work since the gdl library was compiled with an old version of g++, and even with a downgrade, it didn't work. We only have the .so files so I can't rebuilt it :(
